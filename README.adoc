This codebase contains a set of examples for the usage of vertx & vertx-web libraries with RxJava 2 support.

There are currently 3 Verticles:

1. `PongVerticle` (default port `8080`): Simple Ping-Pong http service that replies with plaintext "Pong!" to any request
2. `RollVerticle` (default port `8081`): An http service to roll dice - it has 1 GET endpoint that accepts number of dice and their number of sides,
such as 1d10 or 3d5 and responds with an array of resulting roll values
3. `MainVerticle`: to compose the two mentioned above

There's also a launcher that creates a clustered deployment using Hazelcast Cluster manager
